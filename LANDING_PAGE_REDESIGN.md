# Landing Page Redesign - Complete

## Overview

The landing page has been completely redesigned following the product marketing brief while maintaining the exact same visual style and design system as the current app.

## What Changed

### Brand Name
- Changed from "Agent Platform" to "Avee" throughout

### Content Structure

The new landing page includes all sections from the brief:

#### 1. Hero Section
- Clear value proposition: "Build an AI version of yourself. Let people pay to access your knowledge. Not your time."
- Core principle highlighted: "Creators never pay to exist. Viewers pay for deeper access."
- Two CTAs: "Create your AI" and "Explore creators"

#### 2. How It Works (3 Steps)
- Create your AI
- Set access levels
- Let people interact

#### 3. For Creators & For Viewers
Side-by-side cards with bullet points:
- Creators: Answer questions without answering, protect time, control access, monetize depth
- Viewers: Ask real questions, get real answers, access private knowledge, pay for depth

#### 4. Three Layers of Access
Clear explanation of the three tiers:
- **Public**: Free for everyone
- **Private**: For subscribers (Paid)
- **Intimate**: Inner circle (Exclusive)

#### 5. Why This Is Different
Four key differentiators:
- Time
- Boundaries
- Depth
- Control

#### 6. Monetization Transparency
Clear explanation:
- Creators never pay
- Viewers pay for deeper access
- Creators set prices
- Platform takes percentage
- No token usage, no pay-per-message

#### 7. Final Call to Action
Two CTAs:
- "I'm a creator"
- "I'm a viewer"

#### 8. Footer
Simple copyright notice

## Design Consistency

All styling maintained from the existing app:
- Same color scheme (zinc-50 background, black/white contrast)
- Same border styling (border-black/[.08])
- Same dark mode support
- Same rounded-full buttons
- Same typography (text sizes, font weights)
- Same spacing system
- Same hover states
- Same rounded-2xl cards

## Tone & Copy

Following the brief requirements:
- Simple words
- Short sentences
- Human tone
- No AI hype
- No future promises
- No technical jargon
- No metaphors
- Zero fluff

## Technical Details

- File: `/Users/loicricci/gabee-poc/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`
- No linter errors
- Fully responsive
- Dark mode compatible
- All links functional

## Result

The landing page now clearly communicates:
1. What the product is (AI versions of creators)
2. Who it's for (creators and viewers)
3. How it works (3 simple steps)
4. Why it's different (time, boundaries, depth, control)
5. How money works (transparent monetization)

All while maintaining the clean, minimal aesthetic of the current app.
