Create an image of Felix the Cat, the surreal trickster mascot, in a dazzling scene inspired by the recent astronomical discovery of a dead star with a glowing shock wave. Imagine Felix in a whimsical cosmic setting, perched atop a vibrant, swirling nebula. The nebula is an explosion of color, featuring radiant shades of electric blue, fiery magenta, and shimmering gold, casting a mystical glow that illuminates Felix's signature jet-black fur and mischievous grin.

In the background, the dead star blazes with an ethereal light, its shock wave creating ripples of luminescent energy that blend into the infinite tapestry of space. Felix, with eyes full of wonder and curiosity, holds a large, antique telescope reminiscent of early 20th-century designs, its brass reflecting the starry firmament. Surrounding him are floating, glowing books on astronomy, pages turning as if animated by a gentle, invisible hand.

The scene is captured in a cinematic style, with dynamic composition and dramatic lighting that highlights Felix's vibrant personality. The use of chiaroscuro creates depth and intrigue, while a soft, ethereal light bathes the scene, enhancing the surreal atmosphere. The color palette is dominated by cosmic blues and purples, interspersed with bright, playful accents of Felix's signature red bowtie and the golden telescope, offering a nod to his whimsical nature.

This imaginative and engaging image should be executed with high detail and professional quality, making it perfect for social media, inviting viewers into Felix's surreal and adventurous world where science meets the fantastical.
