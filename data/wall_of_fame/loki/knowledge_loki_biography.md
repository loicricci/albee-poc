From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Norse deity For the Marvel character, see Loki (Marvel Comics) and Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe) . For other uses, see Loki (disambiguation) . Loki with a fishing net (per Reginsmál ) as depicted on an 18th-century Icelandic manuscript (SÁM 66) Loki is a god in Norse mythology . He is the son of Fárbauti (a jötunn ) and Laufey (a goddess), and the brother of Helblindi and Býleistr . Loki is married to the goddess Sigyn and they have two sons, Narfi or Nari and Váli . By the jötunn Angrboða , Loki is the father of Hel , the wolf Fenrir and the world serpent Jörmungandr . In the form of a mare , Loki was impregnated by the stallion Svaðilfari and gave birth to the eight-legged horse Sleipnir . Like other gods, Loki is a shape shifter and in separate sources appears in the form of a salmon , a mare , a fly , and possibly an elderly woman named Þökk (Old Norse 'thanks').

The serpent drips venom from above him that Sigyn collects into a bowl; however, she must empty the bowl when it is full and the venom that drips in the meantime causes Loki to writhe in pain, thereby causing earthquakes. Loki is foretold to eventually break free from his bonds and, among the forces of the jötnar , to go to battle with the gods, during which time his children play a key role in the destruction of all but two humans over the events of Ragnarök . Loki has a particular enmity with the god Heimdallr . The two are in fact prophesied to kill one another during Ragnarök. Loki is attested in the Poetic Edda , compiled in the 13th century from earlier trad...
