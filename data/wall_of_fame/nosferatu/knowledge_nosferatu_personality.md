Description: Count Orlok stalks the crew onboard the ship the Empusa in the 1922 version of Nosferatu. | Count Orlok stalks the crew onboard the ship the Empusa in the 1922 version of Nosferatu. Published 2 January 2025 Even in a world flooded with reboots, remakes and re-imaginings, there is something compelling – dare we say eternal? – about the story of Nosferatu. Film-makers return repeatedly to this bloody, transgressive tale. What is it about the story that we find so hypnotising? Nosferatu Robert Eggers' version is the third straight telling of the story. The first, Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror , was released as long ago as 1922, a German Expressionist horror masterpiece, rich with iconic images. Image source, Getty Images A 1979 iteration, Nosferatu the Vampyre , directed by Werner Herzog, was a slow-burning, crepuscular piece. With his frequent collaborator Klaus Kinski in the title role, Herzog's vision was one of death, disease and the loneliness of eternity as a monster. So where does the much-told story come from? Orlok vs Dracula: To The Undeath! The short answer is Dracula, the quintessential 1897 vampire novel by Irishman Bram Stoker. The director of the 1922 Nosferatu changed the name of Stoker's vampire, Dracula, to Orlok. But he retained many of the ideas and much of the plot of the book – an ancient, crumbling castle in the Carpathian mountains and the vampire travelling by ship to a new home being two significant pillars of the story. What he didn't do was consult the estate of Bram Stoker about using Dracula. It was perfectly obvious to all that Orlok was Dracula with a twist. And certainly clear to Florence Balcombe, Stoker's widow. She took legal action, and in July 1925, a German court ruled that all copies of Nosferat u were to be burned for copyright infringement. But by that stage, it was already out in the world, and copies were hastily made. It was too late. Like the bloodlust of its eponymous monster, it could not be contained. To p...

Nosferatu Study Guide Buy Study Guide Nosferatu is arguably the first great horror movie. Nearly 100 years after it was made, it can still inspire terror, revulsion, and dread. But we're lucky that we even have copies to see today. The film was made under strange circumstances, to say the least. As told by film scholar Thomas Elsaesser in an essay on the film, the idea and much of the artistic direction for Nosferatu came directly from the film's production company, Prana Film. This was the only film the company made. That alone isn't uncommon in the film industry (even today), but it is strange that Prana was spearheaded by a man deeply invested in the occult, Albin Grau. Grau was generally interested in the occult and the sophist movements, each achieving an apex of popularity around the time this film was made. He was a fan of Aleister Crowley's and friends with author Alfred Kubin. Grau was far from the only strange presence involved in the film. Speculation has swirled for years about the true identity of lead actor Max Schreck, with his layers of grotesque makeup in the Count Orlok /Nosferatu rule. The work "schreck" is German for "monster," leading many film buffs to feel that the moniker was a rather on-the-nose pseudonym for some other individual. Schreck does seem to have worked with F.W. Murnau's own mentor, Max Reinhardt, and does have a bit of a filmography outside of Nosferatu . Greta Schroeder, who plays Ellen Hutter in this film, was a Reinhardt collaborator as well. Why are we lucky to have copies of Nosferatu ? Well, Prana thought it could skirt the permission of Bram Stoker's estate to adapt Dracula by changing the story and characters just enough. Hence, Count Dracula was changed to Count Orlok, the Van Helsing character was demoted to the ineffective Professor Bulwer , Dracula's sh...
