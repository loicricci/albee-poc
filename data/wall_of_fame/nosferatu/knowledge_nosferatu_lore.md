However, few vampires have generated as much intrigue and mystery as Nosferatu , the sinister figure that reshaped the history of horror cinema. The Birth of Nosferatu and Vampire Films Nosferatu is a 1922 German silent film directed by F.W. Murnau, an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker’s novel Dracula. To avoid legal issues, the filmmakers altered key elements: Count Dracula became Count Orlok, and London was replaced by the fictional city of Wisborg. A masterpiece of German expressionism, the film employs grim and oppressive settings to narrate the story of Orlok, a vampire who travels from Transylvania to unleash terror in Wisborg. Vlad the Impaler: The Inspiration Behind the Legend Although Nosferatu differs from Dracula , both draw inspiration from the historical figure Vlad III , also known as Vlad the Impaler . This 15th-century prince of Wallachia, a region in present-day Romania, is infamous for his brutal reign. Born in 1431 in Sighișoara, Transylvania, Vlad III was the son of Vlad II Dracul, a member of the Order of the Dragon, a chivalric society dedicated to opposing the Ottoman Empire. After the execution of his father and elder brother, Vlad ascended the throne, gaining notoriety for his ruthless methods, particularl...

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Name associated with vampire fiction " Nosferatu " has been presented as an archaic Romanian word [ 1 ] synonymous with " vampire ". It was largely popularized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Western fiction such as the gothic novel Dracula (1897) and the German expressionist film Nosferatu (1922). One of the suggested etymologies of the term is that it is derived from the Romanian Nesuferitul ('the offensive one' or 'the insufferable one'). Origins of the word [ edit ] The word was popularized in part by its association with the 1922 film. The etymology of the word nosferatu remains undetermined. There is no doubt that it achieved currency through Bram Stoker 's 1897 novel Dracula and its unauthorised first cinematic adaptation, Nosferatu (1922). Stoker identified his source for the term as 19th-century British author and speaker Emily Gerard . It is commonly thought that Gerard introduced the word into print in an 1885 magazine article, "Transylvanian Superstitions", [ 2 ] and in her travelogue The Land Beyond the Forest [ 3 ] (" Transylvania " is Latin for "[the land] across/beyond the forest"). She merely refers to "Nosferatu" as the Romanian word for vampire : [ 4 ] More decidedly evil, however, is the vampire, or nosferatu , in whom every Roumenian peasant believes as firmly as he does in heaven or hell. There are two sorts of vampires—living and dead. The living vampire is in general the illegitimate offspring of two illegitimate persons, but even a flawless pedigree will not ensure anyone against the intrusion of a vampire into his family vault, since every person killed by a nosferatu becomes likewise a vampire after death, and will continue to suck the blood of other innocent people till the spirit has been exorcised, either by opening the grave of the person suspected and driving a stake through the corpse, or firing a pistol shot into the coffin. In very obstinate cases it is further recommended to cut o...
