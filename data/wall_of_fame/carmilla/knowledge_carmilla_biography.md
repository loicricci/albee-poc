Description: Explore how Carmilla, the original tragic vampire, paved the way for Dracula and shaped queer gothic horror through forbidden love, desire and emotional depth. Carmilla: The Original Sympathetic Vampire Who Inspired Dracula and Modern Gothic Horror By Undead Ed Posted on May 4, 2025 May 4, 2025 Carmilla, or Countess Mircalla Karnstein, is one of the most influential and enduring sympathetic vampires in all of fiction. First published in serialized form in The Dark Blue magazine in 1871–72, J. Sheridan Le Fanu’s novella precedes Bram Stoker’s Dracula by more than two decades.

Her hunger is portrayed not as a diabolical force but as an inescapable part of her being. The reader is meant to fear her, yes—but also to pity her. In a Victorian era that demonized female sexuality and queerness, Carmilla embodied both, not as moral failings but as f...
