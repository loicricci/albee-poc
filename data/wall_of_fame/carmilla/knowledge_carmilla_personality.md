Analysis, related quotes, timeline. Carmilla, also known as Mircalla and Millarca, is the story’s eponymous antagonist. A vampire from an old aristocratic family, she appears eternally as a beautiful young woman and preys on vulnerable young women to whom she is sexually attracted. Carmilla uses her beauty and youth to deceive those around her, and as a result they often fail to see her true nature until it’s too late. This is the case when Carmilla comes to prey on the protagonist, Laura , by moving into Laura’s family home after a carriage accident. Carmilla grows close to Laura, taking advantage of her loneliness and naivety and making sexual advances on Laura that Laura somewhat reciprocates. However, Laura always feels a mixture of attraction and fear towards Carmilla, as Carmilla will reveal nothing about her past, she has strange reactions to hearing hymns, and she can be uncomfortably affectionate, making Laura wonder how Carmilla can have such strong emotions after only knowing Laura for a short time. Laura’s fear is well-founded, as Carmilla is secretly visiting Laura’s bedroom at night to bite her, which is slowly weakening Laura and would have eventually killed her if General Spielsdorf , the father of one of Carmilla’s previous victims, hadn’t intervened.

In this way, Carmilla represents an ambivalence about the Victorian era’s attitudes towards female sexuality. On the one hand, Carmilla’s vampiric lesbianism implies that female sexuality is dangerous and pathological, but on the other hand, Laura doesn’t wholly reject Carmilla, and she seems even to grow from their experiences together.

First published as a serial in The Dark Blue from 1871–72, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] the novella subsequently appeared in Le Fanu’s short story collection In a Glass Darkly in 1872. The story of a young woman pursued by the vampire Carmilla, the work popularized the lesbian vampire trope. Since its publication, Carmilla has often been regarded as one of the most influential vampire stories of all time. [ 3 ] The work is narrated by Laura, a young woman living in a secluded Austrian castle, who becomes the object of both affection and predation by the enigmatic Carmilla, leading to a complex and dangerous relationship marked by both romantic desires and vampiric violence. The narrative explores themes of sexual identity , the supernatural , and the tension between innocence and corruption, while maintaining a sense of dread and suspense.
