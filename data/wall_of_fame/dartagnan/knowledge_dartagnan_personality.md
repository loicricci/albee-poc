Description: Get everything you need to know about D’Artagnan in The Three Musketeers. Analysis, related quotes, timeline. | Get everything you need to know about D’Artagnan in The Three Musketeers. Analysis, related quotes, timeline. D’Artagnan is a young man from Gascony who leaves his childhood home for Paris to become a musketeer. D’Artagnan is handsome, intelligent, and brave, which makes him a perfect candidate for M. de Tréville ’s musketeers. However, before he can become a musketeer, he must prove himself worthy. Before long, d’Artagnan gets entangled with all manner of political intrigue along with Athos , Porthos , and Aramis . Despite his young age, d’Artagnan often acts as the leader of the group. Although he’s largely a heroic character, d’Artagnan is not without his faults. He can be selfish and manipulative, as when he uses Kitty ’s affection for him to get revenge on Milady . However, for much of the novel, d’Artagnan is a classic hero and his trials and tribulations eventually earn him the title of musketeer. Like his fellow musketeers, love is constantly on d’Artagnan’s mind, and he eventually finds love with Madame Bonacieux . After performing a daring feat on Madame Bonacieux’s behalf, d’Artagnan starts a formal romance with her, although the two of them are separated for the majority of the novel. Eventually, d’Artagnan is reunited with his love, but he arrives a moment too late: Milady has already poisoned Madame Bonacieux and she dies. As such, d’Artagnan’s narrative arc ends on a depressing note; unlike most heroes he does not save the damsel in distress, and in the story’s closing pages, he is left feeling isolated.
