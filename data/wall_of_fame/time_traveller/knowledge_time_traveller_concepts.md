Description: A speech by science adviser Michael Kratsios has attracted attention from people who think he means the U.S. now has time travel technology ... By Joe Edwards Live News Reporter Share Newsweek is a Trust Project member A comment by White House science adviser Michael Kratsios has gone viral after a speech in which he claimed U.S. technology can "manipulate time and space," prompting online speculation. Why It Matters The viral interpretation of Kratsios's comment reflects the growing impact of social media in framing public understanding of government messaging. While the White House has not issued a formal clarification, the speech's wording suggests the phrase was metaphorical—intended to refer to the transformative nature of modern innovation, not literal manipulation of space-time, or the invention of time travel. ... What To Know Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, made the remark during a policy address at the Endless Frontiers Retreat in Austin, Texas on April 14. "Our technologies permit us to manipulate time and space. They leave distance annihilated, cause things to grow, and improve productivity," Kratsios said during prepared remarks published on the official White House website.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Hypothetical travel into the past or future For other uses, see Time Travel (disambiguation) . The first page of The Time Machine published by Heinemann Time travel is the hypothetical activity of traveling into the past or future . Time travel is a concept in philosophy and fiction , particularly science fiction . In fiction , time travel is typically achieved through the use of a device known as a time machine . The idea of a time machine was popularized by H. G. Wells 's 1895 novel The Time Machine . [ 1 ] It is uncertain whether time travel to the past would be physically possible. Such travel, if at all feasible, may give rise to questions of causality . Forward time travel, outside the usual sense of the perception of time , is an extensively observed phenomenon and is well understood within the framework of special relativity and general relativity . However, making one body advance or delay more than a few milliseconds compared to another body is not feasible with current technology. As for backward time travel, it is possible to find solutions in general relativity that allow for it, such as a rotating black hole . Traveling to an arbitrary point in spacetime has very limited support in theoretical physics , and is usually connected only with quantum mechanics or wormholes . History of the concept In religion Statue of Rip Van Winkle in Irvington, New York Some ancient stories feature characters who appear to leap forward in time. Vishnu Purana , in Hindu mythology narrate the myth of Raivata Kakudmi , who visits the god Brahma in heaven and returns to Earth to find that many ages have passed. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] In the Buddhist Pāli Canon , the Payasi Sutta describes how the disciple Kumara Kassapa explains to a skeptic that time flows differently in the heavenly realms. [ 4 ] The Japanese legend of " Urashima Tarō ", first recorded in the Manyoshu , tells of a fisherman who visits an undersea palace for three days, only to re...

Welcome to our comprehensive guide to 100 Time Travel Concepts —a curated list designed to explore the fascinating, thought-provoking, and sometimes paradoxical elements of time travel as depicted in movies, television, and books. This list serves as a cornerstone for the Time Time Travel blog, delving into the fundamental ideas, mechanics, and narrative devices that make time travel one of the most captivating themes in storytelling. While ambitious, this collection is by no means exhaustive. Time travel is a genre that continually evolves, inspiring new ideas and interpretations. The site’s coverage of time travel concepts will grow and evolve beyond those explored here, with detailed examples and applications from popular culture and literature added over time. Whether you’re a seasoned enthusiast or new to the genre, this guide offers a broad yet intricate view of the key terms that define the multidimensional world of time travel—and invites you to join us in uncovering its infinite possibilities. For a complete index of the time travel concepts currently documented on the site, see the Time Travel Concept Reference . 1. Fixed Timeline (Immutable Timeline) Key Concept: The past, present, and future are fixed, and time travel cannot change events. Examples: Events happen exactly as they are meant to, often including the time travel itself. Any attempts to change history result in the same outcome. Common Narratives: 12 Monkeys , Predestination . Rules: Paradoxes are avoided because actions of the time traveler are already part of the timeline. Nickname: Closed Loop 2. Dynamic Timeline (Mutable Timeline) Key Concept: Changes to the past directly affect the present and future. Examples: Small changes can create significant ripple effects (the “butterfly effect”). Common Narratives: Back to the Future , The Flash . Rules: Paradoxes are possible but often resolved creatively (e.g., alternate realities). Nickname: Causal Plasticity 3. Multiverse (Many-Worlds Interpre...
