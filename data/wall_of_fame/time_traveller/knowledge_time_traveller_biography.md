Traveling to an arbitrary point in spacetime has very limited support in theoretical physics , and is usually connected only with quantum mechanics or wormholes . History of the concept In religion Statue of Rip Van Winkle in Irvington, New York Some ancient stories feature characters who appear to leap forward in time.
