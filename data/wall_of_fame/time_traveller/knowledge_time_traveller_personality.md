Though he is not the narrator of The Time Machine , the Time Traveller is the book’s protagonist. He is an eminent but eccentric British scientist, and his particular interest in time travel leads him to build a time machine that transports himself into the future. Much of the Time Traveller’s character is revealed through his observations and storytelling—for instance, the fact that he values intelligence above all other human traits becomes clear as a result of his obsessive disappointment that the humans of the future are stupid and uncurious. The Time Traveller thinks like a scientist, always forming hypotheses about the world and adjusting them based on his observations, even if he doesn’t like what these observations suggest about humanity. The other notable characteristic of the Time Traveller is that, while he is a member of the British elite (as evident by the company he keeps at dinner parties), he is not at home with them. The other elites view him as far too clever and, for that reason, suspect.

Description: Everything you ever wanted to know about The Time Traveller in The Time Machine, written by masters of this stuff just for you. The Time Traveller Back More Character Analysis Sure, building a Time Machine is pretty impressive, but let's not forget that the Time Traveller also designed his own chair, a chair which "embraced and caressed" the sitter (1.1). We're picturing some sort of Victorian recliner. We're not entirely joking here: the Time Traveller is not just an excellent scientist; he's also a top-notch inventor. The second thing to keep in mind about the Time Traveller is that he's not entirely trusted by his friends. All his guests agree that he is very clever, but in Britain people often say "clever" when they mean "too clever" or "smart aleck." As the unnamed narrator notes, the Time Traveller is "too clever to be believed" (2.1). He may be a scientific genius, but he's also a joker. We learn in the first chapter about a prank he played on his friends the previous Christmas involving a fake ghost. So it's not surprising that his guests don't entirely believe him when he tells them he's going to travel through time. These two sides may seem like they're in conflict – how can the Time Traveller be a serious scientist and a joker at the same time? Science means never having to say you're sorry. If you check out "Themes: Science," you know we think that The Time Machine shows science to be a process that involves quite a lot of failure. If you can't admit you're wrong, you're not going to be able to adjust your theories, and you're not going to be a good scientist. The Time Traveller looks at the lazy Eloi and theorizes that they must have machines to do all their work for them (4.27). But he doesn't find any machinery and meets the Morlocks instead. If he were a bad scientist, he might stick to his theory about the machines and ignore the new data. Since he's a good scientist (more or less), though, he adjusts the theory to fit the facts. Now, i...
