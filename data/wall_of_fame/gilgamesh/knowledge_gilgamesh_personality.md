Analysis, related quotes, timeline. Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, is rumored to be the strongest man in the world. He is at first an arrogant and harsh ruler, but his friendship with Enkidu and Enkidu’s ensuing death show Gilgamesh that even the greatest heroic feats cannot transcend mortality. Throughout the story, Gilgamesh’s understanding of what brings meaning to life is transformed. At first he naively seeks only fame, and pursues this with feats of strength and heroism. After Enkidu’s death, however, Gilgamesh begins to question what meaning life can possibly have in the face of inevitable death. Ultimately, by finding the secret to everlasting life and then losing it, Gilgamesh comes to understand his place in the universe. There is no easy answer to what gives life “meaning,” but Gilgamesh seems to find his purpose in being a just ruler and sharing through writing what he has learned on his adventures.
