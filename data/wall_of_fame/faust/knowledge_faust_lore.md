From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Protagonist of a classic German legend This article is about the German legendary character. For other uses, see Faust (disambiguation) and Faustus . "Doctor Faust" redirects here. For other uses, see Doctor Faustus . Dr. Fausto by Jean-Paul Laurens 1876 'Faust' by Goethe, decorated by Rudolf Seitz , large German edition 51 cm × 38 cm (20 in × 15 in) Faust ( / f aʊ s t / FOWST , German: [faʊst] ⓘ ) is the protagonist of a classic German legend based on the historical Johann Georg Faust ( c. 1480–1540 ). The erudite Faust is highly successful yet dissatisfied with his life, which leads him to make a deal with the Devil at a crossroads , exchanging his soul for unlimited knowledge and worldly pleasures.
