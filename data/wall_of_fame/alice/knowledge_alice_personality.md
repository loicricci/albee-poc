From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Character from children's novel Fictional character Alice Alice character Alice in one of John Tenniel 's illustrations for Alice's Adventures in Wonderland First appearance Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) Last appearance Alice Through the Looking-Glass (2016) Created by Lewis Carroll Alice is a fictional character and the titular protagonist of Lewis Carroll 's children's novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and its sequel, Through the Looking-Glass (1871).

Her appearance changed from Alice's Adventures Under Ground , the first draft of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland , to political cartoonist John Tenniel 's illustrations of her in the two Alice books.

She has been described as a departure from the usual nineteenth-century child protagonist, and the success of the two Alice books inspired numerous sequels, parodies, and imitations, with protagonists similar to Alice in temperament. She has been interpreted through various critical approaches, and has appeared and been re-imagined in numerous adaptations, including Walt Disney's film (1951). Her continuing appeal has been ascribed to her abili...
