Technically speaking, Maria originated as the female equivalent to Marius, an Old Roman masculine name believed to mean either “masculine, virile” (from the Latin “mas”) or “sea” (from the Latin “mare”). However, once Christianity infiltrated Roman society and officially became the state religion in the 4th century, the name Maria was used as the Latinized form of the Hebrew Miriam (the root name for Mary). Miriam, in turn, is probably derived from the Egyptian element “mry” meaning “beloved”, although other etymologists believe Miriam means “rebellion” from a word of uncertain language origin. In any case, in Latin society Maria became mainly associated with Mary, the mother of Jesus (the French use Marie). Although considered too holy for use at first, the names Mary, Marie and Maria were eventually embraced at all levels of medieval European society. In fact, these three names would become the most popular female given names of all time.
