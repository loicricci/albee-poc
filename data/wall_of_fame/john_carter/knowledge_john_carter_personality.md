THE EARTHMENFrom the planet Earth of the late 1800slight years from Barsoom (Mars)JOHN CARTER(Taylor Kitsch)No good’ll come out of me fightin’ your war.Born in Virginia, John Carter served as an officer in the Confederate army in the Civil War. He is an honorable and courageous hero, but the ravages of the Civil War have left him broken, dispirited and personally defeated. Accidentally transported to Barsoom (Mars), Carter begins to realize that his strength and jumping abilities are greatly amplified in the low gravity of the planet. Carter reluctantly begins a journey to rediscover his humanity while at the same time saving his newfound world. COLONEL POWELL(Bryan Cranston)Captain, I’m finding it difficult to reconcile the man on this piece of paper with the one I’m looking at.Colonel Powell is a seasoned, by-the-book, tough-as-nails U.S. cavalry officer. Powell’s mission is to enlist John Carter to fight the Apaches from his unit’s outpost in the Arizona Territory. He is thwarted in this by John Carter’s abject refusal to have anything to do with the militaryor any cause, no matter how just.
