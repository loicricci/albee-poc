From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Group of prominent Hungarian scientists " The Martians " ( Hungarian : "A marslakók" ) were a group of prominent scientists (mostly, but not exclusively, physicists and mathematicians ) of Hungarian Jewish descent who emigrated from Europe to the United States in the early half of the 20th century. [ 1 ] Leo Szilard jokingly suggested that Hungary was a front for aliens from Mars . In an answer to the question of why there is no evidence of intelligent life beyond Earth (called the Fermi paradox ) despite its high probability of existence, Szilárd responded: "They are already here among us – they just call themselves Hungarians." This account is featured in György Marx 's book The Voice of the Martians. [ 2 ] Men included in the description [ edit ] Individuals considered members of The Martians group include: Cornelius Lanczos [ 3 ] Edward Teller Egon Orowan Eugene Wigner [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 3 ] Franz Alexander George de Hevesy George Olah George Pólya John G.

The simplest living things will multiply, evolve by natural selection and become more complicated till eventually active, thinking creatures will emerge. ... Yearning for fresh worlds ... they should spread out all over the Galaxy. These highly exceptional and talented people could hardly overlook such a beautiful place as our Earth. – "And so," Fermi came to his overwhelming question, "if all this has been happening, they should have arrived here by now, so where are they?" – It was Leo Szilard , a man with an impish sense of humor, who supplied the perfect reply to the Fermi Paradox : "They are ...

Description: When speaking about certain figures in Hungarian science, some of their western colleagues suggested that they might as well be Martians. Photo: Bettmann / Getty Images A running joke in scientific circles at the time was that Martians had landed in Hungary sometime around 1900 but soon departed after finding the planet unsuitable. However, these higher beings stayed just long enough to leave behind offspring, which turned into exceptionally brainy scientists, later nicknamed ‘The Martians.’ The moniker included five scientists, all Hungarian Jews, all born between 1881 and 1908: Theodore von Kármán, John von Neumann, Leó Szilárd, Edward Teller, and Eugene Wigner . Martians from Hungary It was a nickname fully embraced by this motley crew of scientists. Hungarian physicist György Marx recounts in his book “The Voice of the Martians” that a question was posed in a discussion as to how higher beings from distant galaxies could overlook such an amazing place as our Earth. “It was Leó Szilárd, a man with an impish sense of humor, who supplied the perfect reply…: “They are among us,” he said, “but they call themselves Hungarians .” Dutch physicist Fritz Houtermans, who knew the pack in the 1930s, later quipped that “ they were really visitors from Mars ,” solidifying this opinion among their peers. When you study their collective biography, they were obviously in good company. One name that pops up is Albert Einstein, the most notable revolutionary in physics at a time when the field of physics was full of revolutionary thinkers. Another is Robert Oppenheimer, the lead inventor of the nuclear bomb, who would afterward call himself “Death, the destroyer of worlds.” There’s no coincidence here: ‘the Martians’ were a rat pack of scientists with an all-new approach to interwar science. They were thinkers who found hidden connections between disciplines and creatively solved problems, leading to developments like the nuclear bomb. (From left) Dr. Theodore Von Kar...

(Image: Henrique Alvim Correa/Wikimedia ) One hundred years ago, Baron Munchausen landed on Mars . In his adventures, the fabulous, if fictional, German nobleman had gone deep underwater and visited the moon. But in 1915, Mars was the fashionable place to visit, and Munchausen was not going to miss out. And no proper trip to Mars was complete without an encounter with a Martian. But which kind of Martian? Bug-eyed? Blue? Smart? Dumb? These questions still plague us. Today, with the mounting evidence of water on Mars , scientists are predicting we’ll find signs of alien life within the next decade; NASA is restarting development of rockets that could send a ship to Mars; and Earthlings are once again imagining what sort of life we might find there. Just this past week, some sharp-eyed observers of images from the Curiosity rover were convinced that they’d spotted a mouse on the planet’s surface . As Redditors pore over the grainy, zoomed-in photo, they are unwittingly participating in a long history of humans speculating on Mars life—either through science or fiction. At the tail end of the 19th century, Percival Lowell, an amateur astronomer and Boston Brahmin, published Mars , a popular account of Martian geography, including, most notably, canals presumably built by some advanced civilization. His book was non-fiction but it launched Mars in the popular Western imagination. Subsequent explorers who reached the Red Planet found flourishing societies of all sorts of Martians—some humanoid, some less so. In the Baron’s case, he met Martians who communicate telepathica...
