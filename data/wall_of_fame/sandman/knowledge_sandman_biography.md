From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Mythical character in European folklore who puts people to sleep "The Sandman" redirects here. For other uses, see Sandman (disambiguation) . The Sandman is a mythical character originating in Germanic and Scandinavian folklore . He visits children in the evening, sprinkles sleep-inducing sand into their eyes and brings dreams. In the morning, the sleep sand is rubbed from the corner of the eyes. Representation in traditional folklore [ edit ] The Sandman is a traditional character in many children's stories and books. In Scandinavian folklore , he is said to sprinkle sand or dust on or into the eyes of children at night to bring on sleep and dreams. [ 1 ] The grit or "sleep" ( rheum ) in one's eyes upon waking is the supposed result of the Sandman's work the previous night. Literature [ edit ] Vilhelm Pedersen representation for the fairy tale " Ole Lukøje " by Hans Christian Andersen Vilhelm Pedersen depiction of "Ole Lukøje". Klaas Vaak entertainer in Themepark Efteling E. T. A. Hoffmann (1776–1822) wrote a short story in 1816 titled Der Sandmann , which showed how sinister such a character could be made. According to the protagonist's nurse, he threw sand in the eyes of children who would not go to sleep, with the result of those eyes falling out and being collected by the Sandman, who then takes the eyes to his iron nest on the Moon and uses them to feed his children. The protagonist of the story grows to associate this nightmarish creature with the genuinely sinister figure of his father's associate, Coppelius. In Romanian folklore, there is a similar character, Moș Ene (Ene the Elder). Hoffmann's version of the sandman is also similar to the French Canadian character known as the Bonhomme Sept Heures (Goodman Seven O’Clock), who, in some versions, throws sand in children's eyes to blind them so that he may capture them. Contrarily to the sandman, his bag is the place where he traps children who do not go to bed. [ 2 ] Han...
