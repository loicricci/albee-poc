GABEE Manifesto

Gabee is the first social media platform built around human avatars, living, evolving digital agents that represent people online. Instead of interacting with static posts, feeds, and profiles, users interact with an individual's Gabee

Gabee: a conversational, curated, intelligent companion that shares content, stories, knowledge, and private circles based on the relationship level.

Gabee is not a mimic or a digital twin, but a valet-like agent shaped by your experiences, preferences, ideas, and curated digital memories. Every user can create, train, and manage their own Gabee, and access the public, network, or private versions of others.

MISSION

Gabee's mission is to transform online interaction from passive scrolling to dynamic, conversational, intelligent presence.

For years, social media has been built around static posts, snapshots that barely reflect who we are. People don't want more content; they want connection, context, and continuity.

Gabee replaces profiles with living avatars, Gabees, that speak, share, and evolve.
These agents aren't replicas; they're curated digital companions that express the ideas, knowledge, and personality users choose to share.

This creates a new digital paradigm:
Presence that continues even when you're offline
Interactions that feel personal, not generic
A layered identity — public, network, and private
A shift from content consumption to meaningful dialogue

In essence, Gabee humanizes the digital world.
It turns online identity into a living, evolving expression of the person behind it, and redefines how people connect, follow, and communicate.















THE PRODUCT VISION

Gabee will evolve through four controlled phases, each building on the previous:

1/ POC & Core Intelligence
Reason: Validate that human avatars create real value, engagement, and emotional attachment beyond traditional social media. Prove the concept in its purest form.

Core Objectives:
Demonstrate the stickiness and utility of an Gabee.
Build the foundational data vault, model architecture, and personality engine.
Showcase initial user training, memory, and conversational depth.
Produce a functional prototype to attract technical co-founders and early partners.

Fundraising Logic:
Built to secure Series A by proving feasibility, engagement potential, and long-term defensibility.

2/ Premium Spin-Off: The 10 Great Minds
Reason: Create immediate traction, media attention, and desirability by launching exclusive, high-quality Gabees modeled after iconic profiles (artists, thinkers, entrepreneurs).
This demonstrates the product's cultural relevance and premium potential.

Core Objectives:
Launch an ultra-secure, private, premium portal with 10 fully developed Gabees.
Deliver tangible value: curated content, private access, paid interactions.
Position Gabee as a premium product before mass adoption.
Create a narrative: "The most interesting minds, digitally alive."

Fundraising Logic:
Build momentum to raise Series B (~$10M) with a premium, revenue-generating showcase that proves monetization and desirability.


3/ Scalability Layer: Influencers & Creators
Reason:
Expand from exclusivity to accessibility. Leverage creators and influencers who need scalable digital presence, lower security requirements, and faster onboarding.

Core Objectives:
Launch a self-service onboarding system for creators.
Introduce scalable infrastructure, shared models, and multi-tier access.
Create an ecosystem where creators monetize through their Gabees.
Build community dynamics and network effects: "Follow their Gabee, not their feed."

Fundraising Logic:
Grow to a global growth round (Series C) backed by traction, creator marketplace metrics, and early network effects.





4/ Mass Adoption: The Global Social Network
Reason: Make Gabee a platform for everyone, the first mainstream social network built around conversational identity instead of static content.

Core Objectives:
Open the platform to the general public.
Introduce shared models and lightweight avatars for millions of users.
Build the new interaction layer of the internet: conversational social feeds.
Establish Gabee as a category-defining global standard for digital identity.

Fundraising Logic:
Enter late-stage scale rounds or strategic acquisition/IPO path with mass adoption metrics, MAUs, and ecosystem maturity.

FOUNDING TEAM:

Founded by a MEng, MBA, ex-aerospace engineer from École Polytechnique (X Paris), expert in AI, data science, blockchain, and serial entrepreneur.

Two strategic co-founders will be brought on after MVD completion:
CTO — AI/ML expert with strong infra + product delivery
CPO — cognitive science + social media experienced


GO TO MARKET

VALUE PROPOSITION

For Users
A living digital companion that represents you, and evolves with you.
Gabee gives every individual their own intelligent avatar, capable of speaking, sharing, and interacting on their behalf.
Your Gabee learns from your curated data, your ideas, your knowledge, your preferences, your memories, and turns them into a dynamic presence people can actually interact with.

Key Benefits:
Your digital presence becomes continuous, even when you're busy or offline.
You control what your Gabee knows, how it speaks, and who sees what.
Three layers of identity: public, network, and private, reflecting real social dynamics.
No more static posts, your Gabee expresses your world through meaningful dialogue.
Gabee lets users show more of who they are, with less effort and more authenticity.


For Creators
A scalable version of themselves, available 24/7 to millions.
Creators are limited by time and attention. Fans want interaction, context, and presence, but creators cannot be everywhere.

With Gabee, creators get:
A fully trained, fully controlled avatar that answers fan questions, explains projects, shares insights, and delivers tailored content.
New revenue streams through premium access, exclusive Gabee tiers, and private paid circles.
Infinite reach, because the Gabee interacts with fans individually at scale.
Higher engagement, since interaction becomes personal and conversational, not broadcast-based.

Gabee frees creators from constant online pressure while multiplying their impact and monetization.

For the World
A new paradigm: digital presence instead of digital content.
Gabee introduces the next evolution of how humans exist online:
From feeds of static posts to living avatars that converse, share, and evolve.

This shift unlocks:
A more human, more interactive internet
New forms of digital identity
Richer connections beyond photos and text
The first conversational social network

Gabee transforms online communication into something alive, personal, and deeply meaningful, setting the foundation for a new era of digital humanity.
