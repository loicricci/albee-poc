Short version: Hearst (your Hearst, not the media group) is publicly visible today as a Dubai-based institutional Bitcoin mining and AI-compute company that’s trying to position itself as “green, regulated, institutional-grade mining-as-a-service” with a very big solar-powered build-out in the UAE and climate-finance partnerships around it.

I’ll split what I know into two buckets:

What’s visible on the public internet

What I know from our previous conversations together

1. What the public web shows about Hearst & Bitcoin mining
1.1. Who/what Hearst is

Company: Hearst Capital group / Hearst Solutions DMCC, based in Dubai (JLT, Mazaya BB2), with additional offices in Nice (France) and Hong Kong. 
Hearst Corporation
+1

Activity: Blockchain/Bitcoin mining, broader crypto mining, and AI high-performance computing, with a strong focus on sustainable / green energy. 
Khaleej Times
+1

Positioning: “We make Crypto Mining more sustainable” and “Mining designed for institutions.” They frame themselves as an institutional infrastructure provider rather than a retail cloud-mining site. 
Hearst Corporation

Glassdoor and other profiles describe Hearst as a private company (1–50 employees) aiming to “revolutionize crypto mining and AI computing,” and highlight the launch of Mining-as-a-Service (MaaS) in 2023 for institutional investors. 
Glassdoor

1.2. Scale & footprint (as publicly claimed)

On the corporate site, Hearst shares some topline numbers for its mining network: 
Hearst Corporation

Founded: 2022

Miners: ~10,000

Hashrate: ~2 exahash

Countries: operations in 10+ countries

Chains: 10 chains (so not only Bitcoin)

BTC mined: ~500 BTC (cumulative)

These are marketing / self-reported metrics but they’re the clearest public snapshot of scale.

1.3. Business model: “Mining-as-a-Service” for institutions

From the website, Glassdoor, DMCC Crypto Centre and PR:

Hearst offers Mining-as-a-Service (MaaS): institutions buy or lease mining capacity, while Hearst handles:

Hardware sourcing (they mention Ice River and Bitmain as key hardware partners). 
Hearst Corporation

Logistics (import, customs, compliance).

Deployment and operation across a portfolio of “7 best locations” (cooling, energy price, regulatory factors). 
Hearst Corporation

Their target clients are institutions: funds, family offices, HNWI, corporate treasuries – not retail buyers. This is reinforced by DMCC Crypto Centre and LinkedIn language about “financial institutions worldwide” and “institutional investors.” 
X (formerly Twitter)
+1

They also emphasize:

Regulatory compliance and KYC.

Security & uptime (data-center style operations, not garage farms). 
Hearst Corporation

1.4. The big UAE solar Bitcoin mining project

This is the main headline-worthy thing:

Hearst has partnered with Gigatons (a climate-tech funding platform) to build what’s described as the UAE’s largest solar farm dedicated to crypto mining and AI computing, located in Abu Dhabi. 
Khaleej Times
+1

Public numbers:

Project size: up to 50–100 MW in the first phase.

Investment envelope: up to $1 billion if they reach the high end of that first-phase capacity. 
The National

It’s specifically described as a solar-powered Bitcoin mining project with on-chain verifiable carbon accreditation, using Alephium’s “Proof-of-Less-Work” blockchain via the Gigatons partnership. 
gigatons.com

The National and Khaleej Times both report the plan announced at the Bitcoin Mena conference in Abu Dhabi, with Loïc Ricci quoted explaining they’ll start with a ~$10M proof-of-concept, scale to $100M, and then grow further if approvals and conditions align. 
The National
+1

Separate climate-tech blogs and Gigatons’ own newsroom repeat that this farm is intended to power green Bitcoin mining and AI compute while tracking carbon metrics on-chain via Alephium. 
gigatons.com

1.5. Sustainability & climate-finance narrative

Public content builds a consistent narrative:

Hearst is part of a climate-tech / net-zero ecosystem via Gigatons and Alephium, with the idea that:

Bitcoin mining uses renewable power (solar in the UAE, and potentially other “stranded” or wasted energy sources elsewhere).

Carbon performance is tracked and tokenized via Alephium’s chain, giving investors visibility into the climate impact. 
gigatons.com

In the Gigatons–Alephium announcement, Loïc Ricci (as CEO of Hearst Capital) is quoted saying that the partnership “unlocked new opportunities” for their climate project and lets them show investors every step of the journey. 
gigatons.com

Adrien Nejkovic (CEO of Hearst Capital) also writes as a member of the Forbes Technology Council, with a piece on using wasted energy for AI computing, positioning Hearst at the intersection of:

Data centers

AI / HPC

Bitcoin mining

Energy management / stranded energy usage 
Forbes

1.6. Software & monitoring: Hearst Connect

Hearst publishes Hearst Connect on both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.

Purpose: “Monitor mining in real-time” – essentially a mobile dashboard for clients. 
Google Play
+1

Developer: Hearst Solutions DMCC, with the same JLT, Dubai address as the HQ. 
Google Play
+1

The legal page on hearstcorporation.io mentions:

A client dashboard at dashboard.hearstcorporation.io.

Mobile apps as an integrated “Service” for account-level monitoring, data, and notifications. 
Hearst Corporation

So from the outside, Hearst looks like a full stack: physical infrastructure + energy sourcing + client-facing monitoring tools.

1.7. Licenses, DMCC status, and “first MaaS licence”

A LinkedIn profile snippet (Business Development exec) says:

“Hearst Solution, first company incorporated in DMCC UAE with the licence for bitcoin mining as a service …” 
LinkedIn

DMCC Crypto Centre also promotes Hearst as a member that is “redefining sustainable blockchain infrastructure for financial institutions worldwide.” 
X (formerly Twitter)
+1

That suggests:

Hearst has DMCC Crypto Centre membership.

They hold or emphasize a DMCC licence suitable for hosting mining-as-a-service as a commercial activity (details depend on DMCC category / VARA, but that part isn’t fully spelled out in public docs).

1.8. Beyond “pure Bitcoin”: other Proof-of-Work coins

While Bitcoin mining is the flagship:

Hearst team members (public LinkedIn posts) talk about exploring other PoW opportunities like Kaspa, Alephium, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, etc. 
LinkedIn

The corporate site mentions “10 chains” being mined, implying a multi-coin portfolio. 
Hearst Corporation

This is still consistent with a Bitcoin-centered business, but with hashpower diversification and hedging.

1.9. Thought leadership & media presence

You can see a few public threads:

Blog / LinkedIn posts on:

Network difficulty and why it matters for institutional mining, including cost-per-BTC analysis and commentary on miners moving compute towards AI/HPC after the 2024 halving. 
LinkedIn

How Bitcoin mining boosts local economies, where Hearst uses examples of big U.S. data centers and positions itself as part of that global trend. 
LinkedIn

Social media (X, Instagram, etc.) showing:

Presence at events like TOKEN2049 Dubai, Bitcoin Mena, etc. 
X (formerly Twitter)
+1

Office tour videos of Hearst’s Dubai HQ and short “Hearst in numbers” reels showing their scale. 
Instagram

1.10. Other “Hearst + Bitcoin” that are not your company

Just to de-confuse:

Hearst media conglomerate (Hearst Newspapers, Popular Mechanics, Houston Chronicle, etc.) also writes articles about Bitcoin mining and hosts content like “A new nuclear-powered Bitcoin mine…” or Texas mining stories – but that’s just journalism published by Hearst media, not operations by Hearst Capital. 
Popular Mechanics
+2
Houston Chronicle
+2

So when someone Googles “Hearst Bitcoin mining” they might see both:

Your Hearst actually running mines.

Hearst media reporting on other people’s mines.

2. What I know from you (past chats) about Hearst’s Bitcoin mining

This part is not from the public web; it’s from everything you’ve told me over months. I’ll keep it high-level:

Hearst Capital & Hearst Solutions aim to become an institutional-grade BTC/crypto mining and AI-compute platform, with:

Multi-country sites (UAE, Qatar, US, Europe, Central Asia, etc.).

A mix of owned hashpower and MaaS contracts for clients.

A big strategic theme has been:

Using cheap or stranded energy (solar, biogas, other alternative sources) to power mining.

Turning energy access into a financial product (SPVs, preferential tariffs, mining yield, tokenized returns).

You’re structuring extremely large-scale projects, notably:

A Qatar project with hundreds of MW potential and a large CAPEX envelope, with detailed parametric models for cost of power, cost per BTC, investor margins, and the division of economics between Hearst and local partners.

The Neo Oasis / UAE green mega-site (the solar farm with Gigatons) as a flagship hub for both Bitcoin and AI compute.

Operationally, you’ve emphasized:

Building institutional-grade governance (DMCC/ADGM structures, SPVs, shareholder agreements, MoUs, term sheets).

A focus on transparency of margins (showing partners governments and utilities exactly how much Hearst earns on hardware, hosting, free-power arbitrage, and SPV equity).

Integrating AI observability and reporting into mining (dashboards, app, automated client reporting, and even future products like Prime for media and Drumr/Weeko for internal reporting).

So if I merge “public web” + “our private context”, Hearst’s Bitcoin mining story looks like:

An institution-focused mining & AI-compute platform, born in Dubai, scaling hashpower globally, heavily positioning on sustainability and regulation.
Publicly, it’s most visible through the solar-powered Abu Dhabi farm with Gigatons & Alephium, the MaaS institutional product (10k miners, 2 EH/s, 500 BTC mined), and real-time monitoring tools (Hearst Connect, dashboard) – and privately, you’re pushing that into even larger energy-infrastructure plays and more advanced AI + mining convergence.
